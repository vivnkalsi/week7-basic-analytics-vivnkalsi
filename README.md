# Week 7 – Basic Business Analytics Project

**Student:** Vivn Narender Pal Kalsi
**Course:** CPSC 201 – Management Information Systems

## 🔍 Summary
Used python to replicate common Excel functions on the Superstore sales dataset and created visualizations with matplotlib. Then, it was created with the same structure in excel. The objective of this project is to bridge the gap between spreadsheet-based business analysis (like Microsoft Excel) and programmatic analytics using Python. We used the Superstore sales dataset to perform typical business data operations — such as summarizing profits, analyzing sales trends, classifying data, and generating visual insights — all by replicating common Excel functions using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
